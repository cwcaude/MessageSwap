# Message Swap
Repository for my Open Source tweak Message Swap. Learn how I made this tweak here : [link](https://cwcaude.github.io/project/tutorial/2020/07/02/iOS-tweak-dev-1.html)

Message Swap allows you to customize the *"Messages"* text at the top of your Messages application. It was created as a way to teach myself the techniques needed to develop iOS Tweaks. More functionality will be added as I continue learning more functionality. This tweak can be installed from my repo [cwcaude.github.io](cwcaude.github.io)

# Planned Functionality
- Ability to replace the text with the number of Unread Messages
- Ability to change the color of the text

# Update Notes

**V1.0** : Initial Release of the tweak. Current functionality allows for a Custom value to be set for this text and to Enable/Disable the tweak
